# tl;dr If you start Maru Desktop with WiFi turned off, you can never turn WiFi back
#       on till a reboot! Override udev's interface renaming to fix.
#
# Android assigns random MAC addresses for the wlan0 WiFi interface if WiFi is turned off.
# These MAC addresses have the form 00:90:4c:**:**:**, with the first three octets constant
# and the remaining three octets being random. When you turn on WiFi, the MAC switches to the
# true constant HW MAC of the device.
#
# The first time you start Maru Desktop, udev adds a matching rule for wlan0’s MAC under
# /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules since it doesn’t recognize the interface.
# This rule makes sure that the interface with this MAC is always assigned “wlan0” as the
# interface name, even if another interface is added first. If a new interface is added with
# a different MAC address, even if it is originally named wlan0, udev will rename it to wlanX,
# with X incrementing for each new MAC address found.
#
# This leads to the condition where starting the desktop with WiFi off and a random MAC adds
# a new persistent net rule and a renaming of the interface to wlanX. If you now try to turn WiFi
# on in Android, it fails because Android can no longer find wlan0.
#
# The solution here is to override /lib/udev/rules.d/75-persistent-net-generator.rules with an empty
# file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ to prevent these renaming rules from automatically being added.
