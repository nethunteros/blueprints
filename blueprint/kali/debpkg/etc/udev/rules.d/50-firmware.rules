# tl;dr video playback (e.g. YouTube) does not work on Android since udevd
#       mistakenly responds to firmware load uevents...force it to
#       ignore firmware uevents and things work!
#
# Some Android device drivers make use of dynamic kernel firmware loading, such
# as Qualcomm's msm_vidc driver does to load "venus" firmware images for playing
# back video for YouTube.
#
# The kernel makes use of events to inform a userspace helper to do the actual
# firmware loading. Unfortunately, instead of Android's native ueventd daemon
# processing the uevent, Linux's udevd mistakenly picks it up and returns failure
# since it obviously cannot find the requested firmware blobs in its isolated rootfs.
#
# This override file ensures that udevd completely ignores firmware uevents.
